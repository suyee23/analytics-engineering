In this assignment, students are instructed to explore and discover the patterns of women’s shoe prices and men’s show prices (10,000 observations each)from a sample of large dataset from Datafiniti’s Product Database. Both datasets include shoe name, brand, price, and more. Each shoe will have an entry for each price found for it and some shoes may have multiple entries.  A full schema for data is available at https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/product-data-schema. By the end of this assignment, students have to prepare a journal article to demonstrate our findings.
